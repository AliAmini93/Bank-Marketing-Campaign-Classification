        "## Objective\n",
        "This repository aims to address the problem of imbalanced classification by implementing and evaluating different machine learning models combined with feature selection strategies. The process involves tuning hyperparameters, selecting the best subset of features, and calibrating model probabilities to achieve optimal performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Dataset Description\n",
        "The dataset used in this repository comes from a bank marketing campaign. The goal is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on various features. The dataset includes both categorical and numerical features:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **ID:** Unique identifier for each client.\n",
        "- **age:** Age of the client.\n",
        "- **job:** Type of job.\n",
        "- **marital:** Marital status.\n",

        "- **balance:** Account balance.\n",
        "- **housing:** Whether the client has a housing loan.\n",
        "- **loan:** Whether the client has a personal loan.\n",
        "- **contact:** Contact communication type.\n",
        "- **day:** Last contact day of the month.\n",
        "- **month:** Last contact month of the year.\n",
        "- **duration:** Duration of the last contact in seconds.\n",
        "- **campaign:** Number of contacts performed during this campaign.\n",
        "- **pdays:** Number of days since the client was last contacted from a previous campaign.\n",
        "- **previous:** Number of contacts performed before this campaign.\n",
        "- **poutcome:** Outcome of the previous marketing campaign.\n",
        "- **subscribed:** Target variable indicating whether the client subscribed to a term deposit.\n",
        "\n",

        "Description: This cell visualizes the distribution of numerical features in the dataset using box plots. By examining these plots, we can identify outliers and the spread of the data for each feature. This helps to determine which transformations (e.g., log transformation, power transformation) might be needed to convert the features into a more normal-like distribution, improving the performance of machine learning models. The features visualized include age, balance, duration, campaign, pdays, previous, and day.\n",

        "\n",
        "*Description:* This step involves encoding categorical features using different methods and evaluating which encoding method works best for the problem of imbalanced classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Label Encoding:**\n",
        "   - **Process:** Converts categorical values into numeric labels. Each unique category value is assigned a unique integer.\n",
        "   - **Usage:** Suitable for ordinal data or when there are no significant order differences between categories.\n",
        "   - **Evaluation:** Implemented Label Encoding and applied Logistic Regression and Random Forest models. Used 3-repeated stratified 5-fold cross-validation to evaluate performance with AUPRC as the metric.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **One-Hot Encoding:**\n",
        "   - **Process:** Converts categorical values into a series of binary columns. Each category value is converted into a new column and assigned a binary value.\n",
        "   - **Usage:** Suitable for nominal data where there is no ordinal relationship between categories.\n",
        "   - **Evaluation:** Implemented One-Hot Encoding and applied Logistic Regression and Random Forest models. Used the same cross-validation and evaluation metric as for Label Encoding.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Target Encoding:**\n",
        "   - **Process:** Encodes categorical values using the target variable. Each category value is replaced with the mean of the target variable for that category.\n",
        "   - **Usage:** Useful when there is a strong relationship between the categorical feature and the target variable.\n",
        "   - **Evaluation:** Implemented Target Encoding with smoothing and applied Logistic Regression and Random Forest models. Used the same cross-validation and evaluation metric.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Hashing Encoding:**\n",
        "   - **Process:** Uses a hashing function to convert categorical values into numeric values. This can reduce the dimensionality of the dataset.\n",
        "   - **Usage:** Suitable for high-cardinality features where One-Hot Encoding would create too many columns.\n",
        "   - **Evaluation:** Implemented Hashing Encoding and applied Logistic Regression and Random Forest models. Used the same cross-validation and evaluation metric.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Selection Criteria:*\n",
        "- **Performance Metric:** Average Precision Score (AUPRC) was used as the main metric to evaluate the encoding methods.\n",
        "- **Model Compatibility:** Evaluated the performance of Logistic Regression and Random Forest models with each encoding method.\n",
        "- **Overall Performance:** The encoding method that yielded the highest AUPRC score with the given models was selected as the best method for further analysis.\n"

        "\n",
        "*Description:* This step involves addressing the issue of imbalanced classification using various techniques and evaluating their effectiveness. The techniques evaluated are SMOTETomek, class weights, and calibrated probability.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **SMOTETomek:**\n",
        "   - **Process:** Combines Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) and Tomek links. SMOTE generates synthetic samples for the minority class, while Tomek links are used to remove overlapping samples from both classes.\n",
        "   - **Usage:** Useful for balancing the dataset by increasing the number of minority class samples and reducing class overlap.\n",
        "   - **Evaluation:** Implemented SMOTETomek with Logistic Regression and Random Forest models. Used 3-repeated stratified 5-fold cross-validation to evaluate performance with AUPRC as the metric.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Class Weights:**\n",
        "   - **Process:** Adjusts the weights of classes inversely proportional to their frequencies in the dataset. This helps to give more importance to the minority class during training.\n",
        "   - **Usage:** Suitable for algorithms that support class weights natively, like Logistic Regression and Random Forest.\n",
        "   - **Evaluation:** Applied class weights with Logistic Regression and Random Forest models. Used the same cross-validation and evaluation metric as for SMOTETomek.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Calibrated Probability:**\n",
        "   - **Process:** Uses a calibration technique to adjust the predicted probabilities of a classifier. This ensures that the predicted probabilities are more reliable.\n",
        "   - **Usage:** Suitable for models where the predicted probabilities need to be accurate, such as when using threshold-based decision-making.\n",
        "   - **Evaluation:** Applied CalibratedClassifierCV with Logistic Regression and Random Forest models. Used the same cross-validation and evaluation metric.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Selection Criteria:*\n",
        "- **Performance Metric:** Average Precision Score (AUPRC) was used as the main metric to evaluate the imbalanced classification techniques.\n",
        "- **Model Compatibility:** Evaluated the performance of Logistic Regression and Random Forest models with each technique.\n",
        "- **Overall Performance:** The imbalanced classification technique that yielded the highest AUPRC score with the given models was selected as the best method for further analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Outcome:*\n",
        "After evaluating the different techniques, it was observed that the **calibrated probability method consistently provided better results** in comparison to SMOTETomek and class weights. Therefore, the calibrated probability method was selected for addressing the imbalanced classification problem in the subsequent steps.\n"

        "   - **Calibrated Probability:** CalibratedClassifierCV is used to ensure that the predicted probabilities are reliable.\n",
        "   - The number of trials for optimization is set to 5, reducing the execution time and resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Process:**\n",
        "   - **Feature Selection:** For each feature selection method (Mutual Information and Pearson Correlation), the optimal number of features is determined.\n",
        "   - **Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning:** For each model, the best hyperparameters are searched using Optuna. The models are evaluated using Stratified 5-fold cross-validation with AUPRC as the metric.\n",
        "   - **Evaluation on Test Set:** The best model and hyperparameters are then used to train the model on the entire training set. The performance is evaluated on the test set using AUPRC, ROC AUC, and the confusion matrix.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Steps:*\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Define the Objective Function for Optuna:**\n",
        "   - The objective function is defined for each combination of model and feature selection method. It includes steps for feature selection, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Initialize Optuna Study:**\n",
        "   - Optuna's study object is initialized for each model and feature selection method combination. The direction is set to \"maximize\" as we aim to maximize the AUPRC.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Optimize Hyperparameters:**\n",
        "   - The study object is used to perform the optimization, which involves multiple trials to find the best hyperparameters for each model and feature selection method combination.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Retrain the Model:**\n",
        "   - The model with the best hyperparameters is retrained on the entire training set using the selected features. Label encoding and calibrated probability are applied.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "*Outcome:*\n",
        "It shows that tuning using Mutual Information as the feature selection strategy enhanced the AUPRC in comparison to the Pearson Correlation.\n"
